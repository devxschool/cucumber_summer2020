What is feature file?
Feature file is a cucumber file. BDD(Behavior driven development) -> we write extensive scenarios for testing the behavior of
a feature. Feature is functionality.

Scenarios are written in Gherkin language which is Pure English wordings. How is it helpful?
Anyone can understand it, BA, PO, Devs - can review and approve the scenarios.
We are planning to build the application according to the written sceanarios. Does it look good?


new hired team members -> Easy to get up to speed with the application flow. Functionality flow.


Scenarios should be implemented with step definitions(glue code).
